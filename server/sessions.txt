req.session.userId = user.id;
{userId: 1} -> send that to redis(in-memory key value database)

Steps:
1.
store in redis:
sess:qsafadg -> {userId: 1}

2.
express-session will set a cookie on my browser asjaifnasfonagn(assigned version of the key is sent to the browser)

3.
when user makes a request
this value asjaifnasfonagn -> will be sent to the server

4.
on the server asjaifnasfonagn would be unsigned(decrypt) into sess:qsafadg

5.
make a request to redis
sess:qsafadg -> {userId: 1}
